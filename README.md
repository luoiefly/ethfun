## Go Ethfun

Ethereum private net for learning and testing smart contract.


## Building the source


Building geth requires both a Go (version 1.7 or later) and a C compiler.
You can install them using your favourite package manager.
Once the dependencies are installed, run

    make geth

or, to build the full suite of utilities:

    make all


### Full node on the main Ethfun network

By far the most common scenario is people wanting to simply interact with the Ethereum network:
create accounts; transfer funds; deploy and interact with contracts. For this particular use-case
the user doesn't care about years-old historical data, so we can fast-sync quickly to the current
state of the network. To do so:

```
$ cd build/bin
$ geth console
```
